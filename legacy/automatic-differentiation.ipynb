    "### Automatic differentiation with `torch.autograd`\n",
    "\n",
    "When training neural networks, the most frequently used algorithm is `back propagation`. In this algorithm, parameters (model weights) are adjusted to according to the `gradient` of the loss function with respect of the given parameter. `The loss function calculates the difference between the expected output and the actual output that a neural network produces`. **The goal is to get the result of the loss function as close to zero as possible**. The algorithm traverse backwards through the network to adjust weights and bias to retrain the model. That's why it's called back propagation. This back and forward process of retraining the model over time to reduce the loss to 0 is called the `gradient descent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute those gradients, PyTorch has a built-in differentiation engine called `torch.autograd`. It supports automatic computation of gradient for any computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the simplest one-layer neural network, with input `x` and `b`, and some loss function. It can be defined in PyTorch in the following manner:"

    "Notice that when we call backward for the second time with the same argument, the value of the gradient is different. This happens because when doing `backward` propagation, PyTorch **accumulates the gradients**, i.e. the value of computed gradients is added to the `grad` property of all leaf nodes of computational graph. If you want to compute the proper gradients, you need to zero out the `grad` property before. In real-life training an `optimizer` helps us to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: previously we were calling `backward()` function without parameters. This is essentially equivalent to calling `backward(torch.tensor(1.0))`, which is a useful way to compute the gradients in case of a scalar-valued function, such as loss during neural network training."
