They aren't models. Please noticed.\n\nAn also, we will twisted the code from GNNdelete project https://github.com/mims-harvard/GNNDelete.\n\n# What we do here?\n\nIn this notebook, we will learn and save all the parameters to json file. And we can load all these parameters in the other notebooks.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import argparse","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Acknowledgement\n\n* https://github.com/SkywardAI/GNNDelete/blob/main/framework/training_args.py","metadata":{}}]}
