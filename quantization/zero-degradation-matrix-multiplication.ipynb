Outlier detection has been widely used and covered in the current literature, and having prior knowledge of the distribution of your features helps with the task of outlier detection. More specifically, we have observed that classic quantization at scale fails for transformer-based models > 6B parameters. \n","\n","As mentioned earlier, 8-bit precision is extremely constrained, therefore quantizing a vector with several big values can produce widly erroneous results. Additionally, because of a built-in characteristic of the transformer-based architecture that links all the elements together, these errors tend to compound as they get propagated across multiple layers. Therefore, mixed-precision decomposition has been developed to facilitate efficient quantization with such extreme outliers.\n","\n","\n","# Inside the MatMul\n","\n","Once the hidden states are computed we extract the outliers using a custom threshold and we decompose the matrix into two parts as explained above, We found that extracting all outliers with magnitude 6 or greater in this way recoveres full inference performance. The outlier part is done in fp16 so it is a classic matrix multiplication, whereas the 8-bit precision using vector-wise multiplication is done by quantizing the weights and hidden states into 8-bit precision using vector-wise quantization --that is, row-wise quantization for the hidden state and column-wise quantization for the weight matrix. After this step, the results are dequantized and returned in half-precision in order to add them to the first matrix multiplication.\n","\n","<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/111/700/455/558/279/509/original/aafbcc617e807c3a.png\" width=\"60%\" heigh=\"60%\" alt=\"matmul\"></div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f9335a10","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.00376,"end_time":"2024-02-15T23:50:23.189979","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-02-15T23:50:23.186219","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# How to use it"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"7024b83b","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-15T23:50:23.199023Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-15T23:50:23.198739Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-15T23:50:39.476459Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-15T23:50:39.475336Z"},"papermill":{"duration":16.285132,"end_time":"2024-02-15T23:50:39.47904","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-02-15T23:50:23.193908","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["%%capture\n","!pip install bitsandbytes==0.41.3"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"258e0ac0","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-15T23:50:39.489552Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-15T23:50:39.488832Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-15T23:50:43.660526Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-15T23:50:43.659711Z"},"papermill":{"duration":4.179415,"end_time":"2024-02-15T23:50:43.662917","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-02-15T23:50:39.483502","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/scipy/__init__.py:146: UserWarning: A NumPy version >=1.16.5 and <1.23.0 is required for this version of SciPy (detected version 1.24.3\n","  warnings.warn(f\"A NumPy version >={np_minversion} and <{np_maxversion}\"\n"]}],"source":["import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","\n","from bitsandbytes.nn import Linear8bitLt"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e630cd50","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.00397,"end_time":"2024-02-15T23:50:43.671431","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-02-15T23:50:43.667461","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["Here we define the model.
