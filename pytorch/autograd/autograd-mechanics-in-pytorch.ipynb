    "> How the autograd works and records the operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autograd is a reverse automatic differentiation system. Conceptually, autograd records a graph recording all of the operations that created the data as you execute operations, giving you a directed acyclic graph whose leaves are the input tensors and roots are the output tensors. By tracing this graph from roots to leaves, you can automatically compute the gradients using the chain rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, autograd represents this graph as a graph of Function objects(really expression), which can be `apply()` ed to compute the result of evaluating the graph. When computing the forward pass, autograd simultaneously performs the requested computations and builds up a graph representing the function that computes the gradient(the `.grad_fn` attribute of each `torch.Tensor` is an entry point into this graph). When the forward pass is completed, PyTorch evaluates this graph in the backwards passs to compute the gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph is recreated from scratch at every  iteration, and this is exactly what allows for using arbitrary Python control flow statements, that can change the overall shape and size of the graph at every iteration. You don't have to encode all possible paths before you launch the training- what you run is what you differentiate."

    "# Setting requires_grad\n",
    "\n",
    "`requires_grad` is a flag, defaulting to false unless wrapped in a `nn.Parameter`, that allows for fine-grained exclusion of subgraphs from gradient computation. It takes effect in both the forward and backward passes:\n",
    "\n",
    "During the forward pass, an operation is only recorded in the backward graph if at least one of its input tensors require grad. During the backward pass `backward()`, only leaf tensors with `requires_grad=True` will have gradients accumulated into their `.grad` fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "It it important to note that even though every tensor has this flag, setting it only make sense for **leaf tensors**(tensors that do not have `grad_fn`, e.g., a `nn.Module's` parameters). **Non-leaf tensors(tensors that do have `grad_fn`) are tensors that have a backward graph associated with them.** Thus their gradients will be needed as an intermediary result to compute the gradient for a leaf tensor that requires grad. From this definition, it is clear that all non-leaf tensors will automatically have `require_grad=True.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting `requires_grad` should be the main way you control which parts if the model are part of the gradient computation, for example, if you need to freeze parts of your pretrained model during model fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To freeze parts of your model, simply apply `.requires_grad_(False)` to the parameters that you don't want updated. And as described above, since computations that use these parameters as inputs would not be recorded in the forward pass, they won't have their `.grad` fields updated in the backward pass because they won't be part of the backward graph in the first place, as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is such as common pattern, `requires_grad` can also be set at the module level with `nn.Module.required_grad_()`. When applied to a module, `.requires_grad_()` takes effect on all of the module's parameters(which have `requires_grad=True` by default)."
