In this algorithm, parameters (model weights) are adjusted to according to the `gradient` of the loss function with respect of the given parameter. The loss function calculates the difference between the expected output and the actual output that a neural network produces. **The goal is to get the result of the loss function as close to zero as possible**. The algorithm traverse backwards through the network to adjust weights and bias to retrain the model. That's why it's called back propagation. This back and forward process of retraining the model over time to reduce the loss to 0 is called the `gradient descent`.\n","\n","To compute those gradients, PyTorch has a built-in differentiation engine called `torch.autograd`.
