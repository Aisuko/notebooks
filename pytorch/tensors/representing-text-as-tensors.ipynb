Computers already represent textual characters as numbers that map to fonts on your screen using encodings such ASCII or UTF-8.\n","\n","![](https://hostux.social/system/media_attachments/files/110/744/867/966/745/527/original/2da950ca853de826.png)\n","\n","We understand what each letter **represents**, and how all characters come topgether to form the words of a sentence. However, computers by themeselves do not have such an understanding, and neural network has to learn the meaning during training. Therefore, we can use different approaches when representing text:\n","\n","**Character-level Representation**\n","\n","We represent text by treating each character as a number. Given that we have $C$ different characters in out text corpus, the world **Hello** would be represented by $5*C$ tensor. Each letter would correspond to a tensor column in one-hot encoding.\n","\n","\n","**Word-level Representation**\n","\n","We create a **vocabulary** of all words in our text, and then represent words using one-hot encoding, This approach is somehow better, because each letter by itself does not have much meaning, and thus by using higher-level semantic concepts - words - we simplify the task for the neural network. However, given large dictionary size, we need to deal with high-dimentional sparse tensors.\n","\n","\n","To unify those approaches, we typically call an atomic piece of text a **a token**. In some cases tokens can be letters, in order cases - words, or parts of words. For example, we can choose to tokenize `indivisible` as `in -divis -ible`, where the # sign represents that the token is a continuation of the previous word. This would allow the root `divis` to always be reperesented by one token, corresponding to one core meaning.\n","\n","The process of converting text into a sequence of tokens is called **tokenization**. Next, we need to assign each token to a number, which we can feed into a neural network. This is called **vectorization**, and is normally done by building a token vocabulary."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"8a03e09f","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-27T06:31:00.010097Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-27T06:31:00.00972Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-27T06:31:11.278071Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-27T06:31:11.276544Z"},"papermill":{"duration":11.279262,"end_time":"2024-02-27T06:31:11.280561","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-02-27T06:31:00.001299","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install portalocker>=2.0.0"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d479f11d","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.006875,"end_time":"2024-02-27T06:31:11.2948","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-02-27T06:31:11.287925","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Text classification task\n","\n","We will start with a simple text classification tasks based on **AG_NEWS** dataset, which is to classify news headliness into one of categories: World, Sports, Business or Sci/Tech.
