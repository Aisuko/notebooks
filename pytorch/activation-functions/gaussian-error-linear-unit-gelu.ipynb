Here are some benefits of using GELU:\n","\n","\n","## Non Linearity\n","\n","Like other activation functions, GELU introduces non-linearity into the model, which allows the model to learn complex patterns.\n","\n","\n","## Smooth Gradient\n","\n","GELU is differentiable and has a smooth gradient everywhere, which can help improve the stability of the model's training.\n","\n","\n","## Better Performance\n","\n","Some studies have found that GELU can lead to better model performance compared to other activation functions, such as `ReLU` or `Leaky ReLU`, especially in transformer models.\n","\n","\n","## Gaussian Distribution\n","\n","The output of GELU follows a Gaussian distribution, which can be beneficial in some cases.\n","\n","\n","However, the choice of activation funciton can depend on the specific task and model architecture.
