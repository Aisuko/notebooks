Each neuron is small computing until that performs simple calculations to collectively solve a problem. They are organized in layers.

Neural networks mimic the way a human brain processes information.\n","\n","\n","# The components of a neural network\n","\n","\n","# Common Types of Activation Functions\n","\n","***Activation function determines whether a neuron should be activated or not***. The computations that happen in a neural network include applying an activation function. If a neuron activates, then it means the input is important. They are different kinds of activation functions. **The choice of which activation funciton to use dependes on what you want the output to be. Another important role of an activation function is to add non-linearity to the model**.\n","\n","\n","## Binary \n","\n","Binary used to set an output node to 1 if function result is positive and 0 if the function result is negative\n","\n","$$f(x)= {\\small \\begin{cases} 0, & \\text{if } x < 0\\\\ 1, & \\text{if } x\\geq 0\\\\ \\end{cases}}$$\n","\n","## Sigmod\n","\n","It is used to predict the probability of an output node being between 0 and 1\n","\n","$$f(x) = {\\large \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}}$$\n","\n","## Tanh\n","\n","It is used to predict the probability of an output node being between -1 and 1.

As an input enter the neuron, it gets multiplied by a weight value and the resulting output is either observed, or passed to the next layer in the neural network. Weights for all neurons in a layer are organize into one tensor.\n","\n","\n","## Bias\n","\n","`Bias` makes up the difference between the activation function's output and its intended output. A low bias suggest that the network is making more assumptions about the form of the output, whereas a high bias value makes less assumptions about the form of the output.\n","\n","We can say that output $y$ of a neural nework layer with weights $W$ and bias $b$ is computed as summation of the inputs multiply by the weights plus the bias\n","\n","$$x = \\sum{(weights * inputs) + bias}$$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"780fa14c","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.005934,"end_time":"2024-02-25T12:15:12.224023","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-02-25T12:15:12.218089","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Building a neural network\n","\n","Neural networks are comprised of layer/modules that perform operations on data.
