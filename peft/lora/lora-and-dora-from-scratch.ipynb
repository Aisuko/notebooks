We are going to implement both LoRA and DoRA in PyTorch from scratch in this notebook. Thanks for [Sebastian Raschka, Phd's greate write-up](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/lora-and-dora-from-scratch) and I credit it at the bottom.\n\n![](https://cdn.masto.host/sigmoidsocial/media_attachments/files/111/966/286/141/991/915/small/82bb43214ea19389.webp)\n\n\n# LoRA Recap\n\nBefore we dive into DoRA, here's a brief recap of how LoRA works. Since LLMs are large, updating all model weights during training can be expensive due to GPU memory limitations. Suppoese we have a large weight matrix $W$ for a given layer. During backpropagation, we learn a $\\Delta W$ matrix, which contains information on how much we want to update the original weights to minimize the loss function during training.\n\nIn regular training and finetuning, the weight update is defined as follows:\n\n$$W_{updated}=W+\\Delta W$$\n\nThe LoRA method proposed by [Hu et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685), offers a more efficient alternative to computing the weight updates $\\Delta W$ **by learning an approximation of it**, $\\Delta W \\approx AB$. In other words, in LoRA, we have the following, where $A$ and $B$ are two small weight matrices:\n\n$$W_{updated}=W+A.B$$\n\n(The \".\" in \"A.B\" stands for matrix multiplication)\n\nThe figure below illustrates these formulas for full finetuning and LoRA side by side.\n\n![](https://cdn.masto.host/sigmoidsocial/media_attachments/files/111/966/350/443/956/461/small/e5254a6add0141f4.webp)\n\n\n## How does LoRA save GPU memory\n\nFor example, if a pretrained weight matrix $W$ is a $1000*1000$ matrix, then the weight update matrix $\\Delta W$ in regular finetuning is a $1000*1000$ matrix as well. In this case, $\\Delta W$ has $1,000,000$ parameters. If we consider a LoRA rank of $2$, them $A$ is a $1000*2$ matrix, and $B$ is a $2*1000$ matrix, and we only have $2*2*1000=4000$ parameters that we ned to update when using LoRA. In the previous example, with a rank of $2$, that's $250$ times fewer parameters.\n\nOf course, $A$ and $B$ can't capture all the information that $\\Delta W$ could capture, **but this is by design**. When using LoRA, we hypothesize that the model requires $W$ to be a large matrix with full rank to capture all the knowledge in the pretraining dataset. However, when we finetune an LLM, we don't need to update all the weights and capture the core information for the adaptation in a smaller number of weights than $\\Delta W$ would; hence, we have the low-rank updates via $AB$.\n\nIf we paid close attention, the full finetuning and LoRA depictions in the figure above look slightly different from the formulas I have shown earlier. That's due to the distributive law of matrix multiplication: we don't have to add the weights with the updated weights but can keep them separate. For instance, if $x$ is the input data, then we can write the following for regular finetuning:\n\n$$x.(W+\\Delta W)=x.W+x.\\Delta W$$\n\nSimilarly, we can write the following for LoRA:\n\n$$x.(W+A.B)=x.W+x.A.B$$\n\nThe fact that we can keep the LoRA weight matrices separate makes LoRA especially attractive. In practice, this means that we don't have to modify the weights of the pretrained model at all, as we can apply the LoRA matrices on the fly. This is especially useful if you are considering hosting a model for multiple customers. Instead of having to save the large updated models for each customer, you only have to save the small set of LoRA weights alongside the original pretrained model.\n\n\n# A LoRA Layer Code Implementation\n\nWe begin by initializing the **LoRALayer** that creates the matrices A and B, along with the **alpha** scaling hyperparameter and the rank hyperparameters. This layer can accept an input and compute the corresponding output, as illustrated in the figure below(The LoRA matrices A and B with rank r).\n\n![](https://cdn.masto.host/sigmoidsocial/media_attachments/files/111/966/454/563/523/540/original/fcc1997b5e645a15.webp)","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch.nn as nn\n\nclass LoRALayer(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_dim, out_dim, rank, alpha):\n        super().__init__()\n        std_dev=1/torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(rank).float())\n        self.A=nn.Parameter(torch.randn(in_dim, rank)*std_dev)\n        self.B=nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(rank, out_dim))\n        self.alpha=alpha\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x=self.alpha*(x@self.A@self.B)\n        return x","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-21T00:23:42.636204Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-21T00:23:42.636581Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-21T00:23:45.066516Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-21T00:23:42.636552Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-21T00:23:45.065755Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this code above, $rank$ is the hyperparameter that controls the inner dimension of the matrices $A$ and $B$. In other words, this parameter controls the number of additional parameters introduced by LoRA and is a key factor in determining the balance between model adaptability and parameter efficiency.\n\nThe second hyperparameter, $alpha$ is a scaling hyperparameter applied to the output of the low-rank adaptation. It essentially controls the extent to which the adapted layer's output is allowed to influence the original output of the layer being adapted. This can be seen as a way to regulate the impact of the low-rank adaptation on the layer's output.\n\nSo far, the $LoRALayer$ class we implemented above allows us to transform the layer inputs x. However, in LoRA, we are usually interested in replacing existing $Linear$ layers so that the weight update is applied to the existing pretrained weights, as shown in the figure below(LoRA applied to an existing linear layer):\n\n![](https://cdn.masto.host/sigmoidsocial/media_attachments/files/111/966/573/735/919/892/original/d5bcf6590c3a346b.png)\n\nTo incorporate the original Linear layer weights as shown in the figure above, we will implement a $LinearWithLoRA$ layer that yse the previously implemented $LoRALayer$ and can be used to replace existing $Linear$ layers in a neural network, for example; self-attention module or feed forward modules in an LLM: ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class LinearWithLoRA(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, linear, rank, alpha):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear=linear\n        self.lora=LoRALayer(\n            linear.in_features, linear.out_features, rank, alpha\n        )\n    \n    def forward(self, x):\n        return self.linear(x)+self.lora(x)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-21T00:23:45.067918Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-21T00:23:45.068408Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-21T00:23:45.073483Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-21T00:23:45.068384Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-21T00:23:45.072432Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note that since we initialize the weight matrix B(self.b in LoraLayer) with zero values in the LoRA layer, the matrix multiplication between A and B results in a matrix consisting of 0's and doesn't affect the original weights (since adding 0 to the original weights does not modify them).\n\nLet's try out LoRA on a small neural network layer represented by a single $Linear$ layer:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch\n\n# Hyperparameters\nrandom_seed=123\n\ntorch.manual_seed(random_seed)\nlayer=nn.Linear(10,2)\nx=torch.randn((1, 10))\n\nprint(x)\nprint(layer)\nprint('Original output:', layer(x))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-21T00:24:18.814717Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-21T00:24:18.815025Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-21T00:24:18.934182Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-21T00:24:18.815001Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-21T00:24:18.933287Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"tensor([[ 0.5490,  0.3671,  0.1219,  0.6466, -1.4168,  0.8429, -0.6307,  1.2340,\n          0.3127,  0.6972]])\nLinear(in_features=10, out_features=2, bias=True)\nOriginal output: tensor([[0.6639, 0.4487]], grad_fn=<AddmmBackward0>)\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's apply LoRA to the Linear layer, we see that the results are the same since we haven't trained the LoRA weights yet.
