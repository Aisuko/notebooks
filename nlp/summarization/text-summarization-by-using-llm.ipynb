The goal of our model is to produce a short sentence describing the content of a dialogue, while maintaining all the important information within that dialogue.\n\nOne of the quantitative metrics we can employ to evaluate performance is the `ROUGE Score`. It is considered one of the best metrics for text summarization and it evaluates performance by comparing the quality of a machine-generated summary to a human generated summary used for reference.\n\nThe similarities between both summaries are measured by analyzing the overlapping `n-grams`, either single words of sequences of words that are present in both summaries. These can be unigrams(ROUGE-1), where only the overlap of sole words is measured; biggrams(ROUGE-2), where we measure the overlap of two-word sequencesl trigrams(ROUGE-3), where we measrure the overlap of three-word sequences; etc. Besides that, we also have:\n\n\n**ROUGE-L**\n\nIt measures the *Longest Common Subsequence(LCS)* between the two summaries, which helps to capture content coverage of the machine-generated text. If both summaries have the sequence \"the apple is green\", we have a match regardless of where they appear in both texts.\n\n**ROUGE-S**\n\nIt avaluates the overlap of skip-bigrams, which are bigrams that permit gaps between words. This helps to measure the coherence of a machine-generated summary. For example, in the phrase \"this apple is absolutely green\", we find a match for the terms such as \"apple\" and \"green\", if that is what we are looking for.\n\nThese scores might typically range from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates no match and 100 indicates a perfect match between both summaries. Besides quantitative metrics, it is useful to use `human evaluation` to analyze the output of language models, since we are able to comprehend text in a wat that a machine does not.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!nvidia-smi # Checking
