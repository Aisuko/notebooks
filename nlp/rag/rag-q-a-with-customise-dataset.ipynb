It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM. It also contains supporting code for evaluation and parameter tuning. Some of the most useful algorithms are implemented on the GPU. Further more, the GPU implementation can accept input from either CPU or GPU memeory.

In addition, the \"Pokémon\" franchise includes the world\\'s top-selling toy brand, the top-selling trading card game with over 25.7billion cards sold, an anime television series that has become the most successful video game adaptation with over 20 seasons and 1,000 episodes in 124 countries, as well as an anime film series, a , books, manga comics, music, and merchandise.
