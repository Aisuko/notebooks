It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM. It also contains supporting code for evaluation and parameter tuning. Some of the most useful algorithms are implemented on the GPU. Further more, the GPU implementation can accept input from either CPU or GPU memeory.

The franchise began as \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Green\" (released outside of Japan as \"Pokémon Red\" and \"Blue\"), a pair of video games for the original Game Boy that were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo in February 1996. \"Pokémon\" has since gone on to become the highest-grossing media franchise of all time, with over in revenue up until March 2017. The original video game series is the second best-selling video game franchise (behind Nintendo\\'s \"Mario\" franchise) with more than 300million copies sold and over 800million mobile downloads. In addition, the \"Pokémon\" franchise includes the world\\'s top-selling toy brand, the top-selling trading card game with over 25.7billion cards sold, an anime television series that has become the most successful video game adaptation with over 20 seasons and 1,000 episodes in 124 countries, as well as an anime film series, a , books, manga comics, music, and merchandise. The franchise is also represented in other Nintendo media, such as the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series. In November 2005, 4Kids Entertainment, which had managed the non-game related licensing of \"Pokémon\", announced that it had agreed not to renew the \"Pokémon\" representation agreement.
