If we have ever asked a virtual assistant like Siri what the weather is, then we have have used a question answering model before. There are two common types of question answering tasks:\n","\n","* **Extractive:** extract the answer from the given context, most of time is a given set of documents or passges. The model selectes the answer from the existing text without any alteration or rephrasing.\n","\n","\n","* **Abstractive:** generate an answer from the context that correctly answers the question in more human-like manner. \n","\n","Abstractive answers are often more suitable for conversations where inforamtion is convoluted and unstructured, as they can provide more coherent and concise responses.\n","\n","\n","We will Finetune a pretrained model with a Question Answering label datasets.
