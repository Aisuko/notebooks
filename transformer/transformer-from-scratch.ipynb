It is quite revolutionary as previous models used to do sequence-to-sequences learning(machine translation, speech-to-text, etc...) relied on RNNs which were computationnally expensive in the sense they had to process sequences step by step, whereas Transformers only need to look once at the whole sequence, moving the time complexity from $O(n)$ to $O(1)$.\n","\n","![](https://cdn.masto.host/sigmoidsocial/media_attachments/files/112/012/999/887/099/116/original/aa9be4499ab4b301.webp)\n","\n","\n","## Encoder\n","\n","It has a `Multi-Head Attention` mechanism and a fully connected `Feed-Forward network`. There are also residual connections around two sub-layers, plus layer normalization for the output of each sub-layer.

There is also a modification of the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder block to avoid positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking ensures that the predictions for position `i` depend solely on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n","\n","Both the encoder and decoder blocks are repeated N times.
