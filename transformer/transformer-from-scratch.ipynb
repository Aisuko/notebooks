There are also residual connections around two sub-layers, plus layer normalization for the output of each sub-layer. All sub-layers in the model and the embedding layers produce outputs of dimension $d_{model}=512$.\n\n**Decoder**\n\nThe decoder follows a similar structure, but it inserts a third sub-layer taht performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder block. There is also a modification of the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder block to avoid positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking ensures that the predictions for position `i` depend solely on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n\nBoth the encoder and decoder blocks are repeated N times. In the original paper, it is N=6, and we will define a similar value in this notebook.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Input Embeddings\n\nThe `InputEmbeddings` class below is responsible for converting the input text into numerical vectors of `d_model` dimensions.
