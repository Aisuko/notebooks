The previously notebooks are below:\n","* [Encoder in Transformers Architecture](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aisuko/encoder-in-transformers-architecture)\n","* [Decoder in Transformers architecture](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aisuko/decoder-in-transformers-architecture)\n","* [Coding the Self-Attention Mechanism](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aisuko/coding-the-self-attention-mechanism)\n","* [Coding the Multi-Head Attention](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aisuko/coding-the-multi-head-attention)\n","* [Coding Cross-Attention](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aisuko/coding-cross-attention)\n","\n","\n","And the causal self-attention mechanism is also often referred to as **masked self-attention**. In the original transformer architecture, it corresponds to the \"masked multi-head attention\" module - for simplicity, we will look at a single attention head in this section, but the same concept generalizes to multiple heads.\n","\n","<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/111/820/570/310/327/483/original/9c619019f8f9a286.webp\" width=\"80%\" heigh=\"80%\" alt=\"Causal self-attetion/masked self-attention\"></div>\n","\n","**It ensures that the outputs for a certain position in a sequence is based only on the known outputs at previous positions and not on future positions**. In simper terms, it ensures that the prediction for each next word should only depend on the preceding words. To achieve this in GPT-like LLMs, for each token processed, we mask out the feature tokens, which come after the current token in the input text.\n","\n","The application of a causal mask to the attention weights for hiding future input tokens in the inputs is illustrated in the figure below.
