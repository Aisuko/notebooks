This introduces biased that traditional time series models struggle to handle.\n\n## Nonlinear trends and seasonality\n\nnvironmental data usually exhibits strong seasonal patterns(e.g, temperature, rainfall) and long-term trends(e.g. global warming). Capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term patterns in a single model is diffcult.\n\n## High variability and noise\n\nNatural phenomena are subject to high variability, with many factors(e.g., temperature, air pollution, humidity) contributing to the overall state of the environment. This noise makes it difficult for forecasting models to detect true patterns.\n\n## External influenece\n\nEnvironmental systems are affected by external, often uppredicatable, fores. For instance, human activities such as deforestation or urbanization can drastically alter predictions that reply solelu on historial data.\n\n## Multivatiate dependencies\n\nEnvironmental systems often have multiple vatiables influencing on another. For example, in air quality forecasting, temperature, humidity, and wind speed all play interconnected roles. Capturing these multivariate dependencies requires more advanced modeling techniques.\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as
